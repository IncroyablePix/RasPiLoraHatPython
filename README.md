# üë®‚Äçüíª Dragino LoRa/GPS HAT for Raspberry Pi Driver and Python module üë®‚Äçüíª
This driver/python module was based on [the official Dragino LoRa/GPS HAT example code](https://github.com/dragino/rpi-lora-tranceiver), for the [Dragino LoRa/GPS hat for Raspberry Pi](https://www.dragino.com/products/lora/item/106-lora-gps-hat.html).
This source code is provided as is and is granted with no warranty of any kind. Use at your own risk.

## Installation
The installation is pretty easy and has a few requirements.

### Requirements
* Raspberry Pi 2+ with Dragino LoRa/GPS HAT
* Python 3.6+
* CMake 3.16+
* WiringPi (Probably already installed on your Raspberry Pi.)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Move to the cloned directory
3. Run `sudo chmod +x ./setup.sh && sudo ./setup.sh`

This will give you access to the **lora** module in Python. Since the driver is written in C, you may also write your application in C/C++ as depicted in the Sample directory.

## Usage
The **lorapy** module has a few features that you can use to interact with the LoRa/GPS HAT. lorapy exports one class : LoRaCom.

### LoRaCom
This class is the main and only class of the lorapy module. It is used to interact with the LoRa/GPS HAT.

#### Constructor
The constructor takes 2 arguments:
* **frequency**: The frequency to use for the LoRa communication. This is an integer value in Hz. For Europe you can set 868000000.
* **sf**: The spreading factor to use for the LoRa communication. This is an integer value. You could simply use 7.

#### Methods
* **set_on_receive**: This method is used to set the callback function that will be called when a message is received. It thus takes one argument:
  * **on_receive**: The callback function that will be called when a message is received. This function takes 1 argument:
    * **payload**: The payload of the received message as a Python string.

* **listen_once**: This method is used to listen once, returning the received message as plain text. It takes no argument.

* **send**: This method is used to send a message. It takes 1 argument:
  * **payload**: The payload to send as a Python string.

* **stop**: This method is used to stop listening. It takes no argument.

#### Listening example
The simplest ways is to just use the **listen_once** method which returns the message as plain text.

```python
from lorapy import LoRaCom

com = LoRaCom(868_000_000, 7)
msg = com.listen_once()
```

#### Sending example
The simplest way to send a message is to use the **send** method.

```python
from lorapy import LoRaCom

com = LoRaCom(868_000_000, 7)
com.send("Hello world!")
```

‚õî The send function is currently not stable and might not work as expected! ‚õî
